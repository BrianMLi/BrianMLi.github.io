A trustworthy employee who developed a strong attention to detail with developed skills such as software development, problem solving, and team communication. \n\n# Currently\n\nAt Home (stay safe!) I primarily have worked as a front-end developer in the past, and continue to brush up on my skills every day with Leetcode and Projects. I enjoy collecting, gaming, and baking on the side. I've also recently gotten into [keyboards and modding them](https://brianmli.medium.com/the-basics-custom-keyboard-711c6a665cbe)! \n<br />\n<br />\nI've also finally had the extra time to work on a passion of mine: Game Development! I've been working through Unity Learn on projects like Rudy's Adventure and 2D Roguelike as I want to create a 2D RPG game with elements of loot grinding, build variety/planning, and dungeon crawling.\n\n# Some history\n\n- I got to use a computer from a young age, around 6-7 years old, and fondly remembering playing with my brother and dad. We would always get together on the weekends to play American Conquest together against the A.I. or watch each other play the campaign.\n\n- From there, I only got more into it. My brother and I playing Age of Empires soon after (hype for AoE 4!) together, playing Civilization IV, and even eventually getting a PS3 later.\n\n- In my later elementary years, I was mostly on Skype and Facebook with my friends when I wasn't playing on the Playstation. My favorite games back then were Assassin's Creed, Call of Duty, and RPGs (like Skyrim). Aside from that, I was also playing on the basketball and badminton teams for fun.\n\n- When I was about 12, I also joined the Royal Canadian Army Cadets which helped me train my undisciplined energy into being more productive and patient. I remember always being super excited to join since I loved military history and all things related to it, and the thought of wearing an army uniform was thrilling.\n\n- By middle school, I was slowly getting back into PC after my tenure with the Playstation. I remember seeing the technical demo for Crysis 3 and was absolutely blown away with the graphical fidelity and it instantly made me want to build a PC again. \n\n- Through highschool, my friends and I moved from Skype to Discord (wow, its gotten big) and played games together every day. I think that was when I got to play the most! From grinding Diablo 3 to playing more competitively on Siege (still going strong!) to modding Skyrim!\n\n- It was around this time when I started thinking more about a career in computer science. The thought of being able to develop and work on programs, applications, and games that I used everyday was amazing. I was curious about how everything I was using from my phone to desktop to even my homework was all powered by code.\n\n- Once I was at UBC, I learned more about the slippery slope of playing games. I barely survived my first year (let's not talk about that...) and scaled back a lot on my gaming. When I actually began to pay attention in class and do my homework, suddenly everything was so much more easy.\n\n- Still though, it didn't stop me from joining the UBC Esports Association and getting involved with competitive R6 Siege. It lit a fire in me to get even more into esports than I was before, from studying opponents to pro players and coming up with strategies to practicing everyday to get better.\n\n- At my co-op, I also finally got to fulfill a long time wish of mine: to play DnD! It was definitely some of the best few months of my life as I played several different games and enjoyed them thouroughly. I also learned a lot about React and TypeScript there, kickstarting my front-end dev career.\n\n# I like\n\n- Building Computers\n- Tabletop Games (like DnD)\n- Video Games + Esports \n- History\n- Baking\n- Investing / Stocks\n- Collecting / Painting Figurines (and other things!)\n- Keyboards (and modding them)\n\n# Fun(ish) facts\n\n- I am a [writer](https://towardsdev.com/using-reacts-useeffect-hook-b345de0afe15) on [TowardsDev.com](https://towardsdev.com/using-reacts-usestate-hook-44c758e46aa)\n- I am a [writer](https://medium.com/codex/2d-level-generation-for-unity-c7a8185b846a) on [CodeX](https://medium.com/codex)\n- I collect (hoard) a lot of interesting things\n- I love cats but am allergic to them!\n- I gain allergies (power ups?) every few years\n- I have too many keyboards\n- I recently started a [blog](https://brianmli.medium.com/) about things I recently learned or am doing\n- I like to play a [stock simulator](https://www.investopedia.com/simulator/home.aspx) (since I don't have money like that) and have had anywhere from 50% to 100% annual returns \n- I'm great at video games\n- I suck at video games\n- I listen to kpop and watch korean dramas\n\n# Favorites list\n- Games: Rainbow Six: Siege, Beat Saber, Skyrim, and Divinity Original Sin 2\n- Food: Fried Chicken, Ramen, and Cookies\n- Drinks: Root Beer and anything ice cold\n- Places: Vancouver, Hong Kong, and Korea\n\n# Current computer\n- GPU: EVGA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti FTW3\n- CPU: Intel i9-9900k CPU @ 5.00GHz OC\n- Cooler: NZXT - Kraken x62 Rev 2\n- RAM: G.SKILL TridentZ RGB DDR4 32GB 3600MHz CL16\n- Motherboard: ASUS ROG Strix Z390-E\n- Case: Corsair Obsidian 500D RGB\n- SSD: Samsung 970 EVO 500GB M.2\n- Monitor: Acer Predator XB271HU 27in G-SYNC IPS Monitor 2560X1440 144Hz 4ms\n\n# I dream of\n\n- buying more things.\n- being smarter.\n- living a good life.\n- nothing much.\n\n### Feel free to [contact](https://brianmli.github.io/site/contact) me anytime for more information\n",m=d.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,h=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},e);return Object(a.jsx)(i.b,Object(o.a)({},n))};n.default=function(){return Object(a.jsx)(l.a,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Brian Li",children:Object(a.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[Object(a.jsx)("header",{children:Object(a.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[Object(a.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:Object(a.jsx)(i.b,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),Object(a.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",m," words)"]})]})}),Object(a.jsx)(s.a,{source:d,renderers:{Link:h},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
