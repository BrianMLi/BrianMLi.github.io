# Currently

At Home (stay safe!) I primarily have worked as a front-end developer in the past, and continue to brush up on my skills every day with Leetcode and Projects. I enjoy collecting, gaming, and baking on the side. I've also recently gotten into keyboards and modding them!

# Some history

- I got to use a computer from a young age, around 6-7 years old, and fondly remembering playing with my brother and dad. We would always get together on the weekends to play American Conquest together against the A.I. or watch each other play the campaign.

- From there, I only got more into it. My brother and I playing Age of Empires soon after (hype for AoE 4!) together, playing Civilization IV, and even eventually getting a PS3 later.

- In my later elementary years, I was mostly on Skype and Facebook with my friends when I wasn't playing on the Playstation. My favorite games back then were Assassin's Creed, Call of Duty, and RPGs (like Skyrim). Aside from that, I was also playing on the basketball and badminton teams for fun.

- When I was about 12, I also joined the Royal Canadian Army Cadets which helped me train my undisciplined energy into being more productive and patient. I remember always being super excited to join since I loved military history and all things related to it, and the thought of wearing a army uniform was thrilling.

- By middle school, I was slowly getting back into PC after my tenure with the Playstation. I remember seeing the technical demo for Crysis 3 and was absolutely blown away with the graphical fidelity and it instantly made me want to build a PC again. 

- Through highschool, my friends and I moved from Skype to Discord (wow, its gotten big) and played games together every day. I think that was when I got to play the most! From grinding Diablo 3 to playing more competitively on Siege (still going strong!) to modding Skyrim!

- It was around this time when I started thinking more about a career in computer science. The thought of being able to develop and work on programs, applications, and games that I used everyday was amazing. I was curious about how everything I was using from my phone to desktop to even my homework was all powered by code.

- Once I was at UBC, I learned more about the slippery slope of playing games. I barely survived my first year (let's not talk about that...) and scaled back a lot on my gaming. When I actually began to pay attention in class and do my homework, suddenly everything was so much more easy.

- Still though, it didn't stop me from joining the UBC Esports Association and getting involved with competitive R6 Siege. It lit a fire in me to get even more into esports than I was before, from studying opponents to pro players and coming up with strategies to practicing everyday to get better.

- At my co-op, I also finally got to fulfill a long time wish of mine: to play DnD! It was definitely some of the best few months of my life as I played several different games and enjoyed them thouroughly. I also learned a lot about React and TypeScript there, kickstarting my front-end dev career.
